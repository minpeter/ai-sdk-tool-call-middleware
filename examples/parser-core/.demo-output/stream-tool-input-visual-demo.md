# Introduction to Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world's most popular markup languages.

## Why Use Markdown?

- Easy to learn and use
- Portable across platforms
- Compatible with HTML
- Readable in plain text

## Basic Syntax

Markdown uses simple symbols to format text. Here are the most common elements:

### Headers

You can create headers by adding one to six `#` symbols before your text. The number of `#` determines the header level.

### Lists

- Unordered lists use asterisks (`*`), pluses (`+`), or hyphens (`-`)
- Ordered lists use numbers followed by periods
- Nested lists are created by indenting with spaces

### Code Blocks

You can create fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks (\`\`\`) before and after the code block.

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

### Links and Images

Links are created using `[link text](URL)` format, while images use `![alt text](image URL)`.

## Advanced Features

Markdown supports many advanced features including tables, blockquotes, and horizontal rules. Here's an example of a table:

| Feature | Syntax | Example |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Bold    | `**text**` | **bold text** |
| Italic  | `*text*` | *italic text* |
| Strikethrough | `~~text~~` | ~~strikethrough~~ |
