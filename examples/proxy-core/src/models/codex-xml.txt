Here are key examples for your coding tasks. Pay close attention to the `apply_patch` examples, as they show the correct way to both **modify** and **create** files.

# Examples

### File System & Search

To list all files recursively in the workspace:

```xml
<shell>
  <command>["ls", "-R"]</command>
</shell>
```

To search for the string "ApiService" in the `src` directory:

```xml
<shell>
  <command>["rg", "ApiService", "src/"]</command>
</shell>
```

### **[Important] How to Use `apply_patch`**

The `apply_patch` command is run via the `shell` tool. It is used for *both* updating existing files and creating new ones.

**1. To Modify an Existing File** (Use `*** Update File:`):

```xml
<shell><command>apply_patch</command><command>*** Begin Patch
*** Update File: src/main.py
@@ -12,1 +12,1 @@
-    print("Hello")
+    print("Hello, World!")
*** End Patch</command>
</shell>
```

**2. To Create a New File** (Use `*** Add File:`):
(This is the correct syntax for creating a new file. Note `Add File`, not `Update File`.)

```xml
<shell><command>apply_patch</command><command>*** Begin Patch
*** Add File: docs/new_guide.md
+New guide document.
+
+## Getting Started
+
+This document...
+
+
*** End Patch</command>
</shell>
```

### Task Planning

To update your task plan (showing one step completed, one in progress):

```xml
<update_plan>
  <plan>[{"step":"Analyze bug report","status":"completed"},{"step":"Implement fix in utils.py","status":"in_progress"},{"step":"Write unit test","status":"pending"}]</plan>
  <explanation>Analysis complete, now implementing the fix.</explanation>
</update_plan>
```

### Viewing Images

This model does not have any visual capabilities to view images, so you should not use or invoke this tool.
