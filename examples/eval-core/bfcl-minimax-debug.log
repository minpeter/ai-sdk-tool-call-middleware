The area \(A\) of a triangle is given by  

\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}.
\]

Plugging in the given values:

\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5 = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25.
\]

**Area:** **25 square units**.

The hypotenuse \(c\) of a right‑triangle with legs \(a=4\) and \(b=5\) is found from the Pythagorean theorem:

\[
c = \sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}} = \sqrt{4^{2}+5^{2}} = \sqrt{16+25} = \sqrt{41}.
\]

So the exact length is \(\boxed{\sqrt{41}}\), which is approximately

\[
\sqrt{41} \approx 6.403124237.
\]

The factorial of 5, denoted as 5!, is calculated as follows:

5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120

This uses basic mathematical multiplication functions to compute the product of all positive integers up to 5.
