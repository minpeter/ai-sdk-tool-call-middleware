**Learning:** O(N) string-scanning utilities in streaming buffers can become O(N^2) hotspots due to repeated scanning of a growing buffer. Limiting the scan range based on the target string length and avoiding allocations (substrings) in the inner loop is crucial. Additionally, finding the longest matching suffix is often more correct than finding the shortest for scanner-like utilities.
**Action:** Always check the loop boundaries of string-scanning utilities to ensure they are constrained by the search target length rather than the input buffer length.
