Rename the JSON protocol surface from `jsonProtocol` to `hermesProtocol` and align Hermes prompt/tool-response behavior with the vLLM Hermes format.

Expand Hermes-focused parser test coverage (including nested schema rendering) and update protocol/preconfigured middleware references to the new naming.

Refresh README and example documentation, including parser-core example filename cleanup and an AI SDK compatibility matrix in the top-level README.
